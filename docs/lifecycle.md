# Task lifecycle: live, archive, purge

queohoh keeps a **track record** of work, but the queue pane should stay
focused on what still matters. Lifecycle has three layers:

| Layer | Meaning | Storage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Live queue** | Active or still-relevant work | `~/.local/state/queohoh/tasks/` |
| **Archive** | Soft dismiss — “I don’t care right now,” still recoverable history | `…/archive/` |
| **Purge** | Hard cleanup — file removed; no longer on the board | gone |

**Archive is not a permanent museum.** It is the list of things you soft-dismissed.
**Purge** is when that record’s life ends.

```
                    ┌─────────────┐
   create/enqueue → │    LIVE     │ ← running / queued / failed / etc.
                    └──────┬──────┘
           on_done:archive │  or human [a]rchive
                           ▼
                    ┌─────────────┐
                    │   ARCHIVE   │  track record (dimmed in TUI)
                    └──────┬──────┘
                           │
        worktree removed   │   purge_after_days
        (bound tasks)      │   (any terminal task)
                           ▼
                       ┌───────┐
                       │ PURGE │  deleted from disk
                       └───────┘
```

## After a run finishes

Terminal statuses: `done`, `failed`, `cancelled`, `verify-failed`, `skipped`.

### Soft path — `on_done` (definition only)

Set on a task definition’s `config.yaml`:

```yaml
on_done: stay     # default — leave successful runs on the live list
on_done: archive  # on success only, move to archive immediately
```

| Outcome | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| **`done`** + `on_done: stay` | Stays **live** until human archives or purge |
| **`done`** + `on_done: archive` | **Archived** as soon as the run succeeds |
| **failed / cancelled / verify-failed / skipped** | Always stay **live** until human archive or purge (so problems remain visible) |

Legacy alias: `archive_on_done: true` → treated as `on_done: archive`.

Ad-hoc tasks (no definition) always behave like `on_done: stay`.

### Manual archive

In the TUI, archive moves a terminal row live → archive. Unarchive reverses it.
That is the same soft-dismiss as `on_done: archive`, just human-driven.

---

## Purge — hard cleanup

### 1. Worktree removed → purge

When a worktree disappears (TUI remove, external `git worktree remove`, etc.):

1. **Cancel** live non-terminal work on that worktree (queued / needs-input /
   stop running).
2. **Purge** every task that targeted that worktree — live **or** archived.

The lane is gone; the board should not keep its history. This is independent of
`on_done` and of age.

**`@repo` / primary checkout never goes away**, so worktree purge never fires
for main-checkout tasks. Those need `purge_after_days` (below).

### 2. Age — `purge_after_days`

Hard-delete **terminal** tasks after N days, whether they sit on **live** or
**archive**.

| Clock | `finished_at`, falling back to `created` if missing |
| --- | --- |
| Statuses | All terminal (`done`, `failed`, `cancelled`, `verify-failed`, `skipped`) |
| Non-terminal | Never age-purged (a long running task is safe) |

**Precedence:**

1. Task stamp (from the definition at create time)
2. Live definition lookup (`purge_after_days` on the def — config edits apply)
3. Workspace global `purge_after_days` (default **14**)

```yaml
# config.yaml (workspace)
purge_after_days: 14
```

```yaml
# tasks/mail-check/config.yaml — override for a noisy cron
on_done: archive
purge_after_days: 1
```

Ad-hoc tasks use **only** the global value (no def to override).

Legacy: `archive_after_days` in config is still accepted as a fallback if
`purge_after_days` is absent. Def-level `task_retention_days` maps to
`purge_after_days` when the new key is missing (old “soft age-archive” is gone;
age only hard-purges now).

---

## Recommended patterns

| Kind of work | Suggested config |
| --- | --- |
| PR / worktree feature work | default (`on_done: stay`); worktree remove purges; global 14d backstop |
| Noisy `@repo` cron (mail-check, react bots) | `on_done: archive` + short `purge_after_days: 1` (or 3–7) |
| Important ops on main checkout | `on_done: stay` (or archive) + rely on global 14, or set def purge explicitly |
| Ad-hoc enqueue | global `purge_after_days` only — set global to avoid infinite live clutter |

---

## TUI notes

- **Live** finished rows show in the FINISHED section of the queue.
- **Archived** rows are dimmed; newest ~200 are on the wire (`ARCHIVED_WIRE_MAX`).
- Rows whose worktree was deleted used to be **hidden** in the TUI even while
  files remained; the engine now **purges** those tasks so hide-vs-delete is not
  a second mental model.

## Definition config cheat sheet

```yaml
# optional — default stay
on_done: archive

# optional — default = workspace purge_after_days (14)
purge_after_days: 1
```

Workspace:

```yaml
purge_after_days: 14
```
